Sentiment Analysis of tweets using python and ML

The project involves analysis of tweets to determine their sentiment as positive or negatice. Replies to tweets of famous personalities were scraped to generate the database. The tweets' database was generated with the aid of a simple script and the use of a third party service, Tweepy. For the second part of the project, the data was cleaned and visualized to gain basic insights. The sentiment analysis of the tweets was implemented using TextBlob, a python library, based on the Natural Language Toolkit.
